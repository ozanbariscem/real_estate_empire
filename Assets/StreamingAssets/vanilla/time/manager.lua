-- But remember, with great power comes what? Finish it.

-- These events are called after their c# counterpart

-- Also a little self note for the future this whole class could be handled with this Lua script
-- Since it's not a heavy class and doesn't require the speed of c#

-- First ever streaming asset loaded by the c# Time.Manager classes
-- Pretty much nothing is loaded at this point
