    // Effects/Modifiers only effect investments regardless of their types

    // Unfortunately you can't add new functionality to effects for performance reasons (you can suggest me to add new ones!)
    // But you can add new modifiers as long as they have the following values
    // "tag": "value"
    // "type": "percentage" | "direct"
    {
        "tag": "value",
        "type": "percentage"
